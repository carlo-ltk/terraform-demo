# terraform-demo



This repo collects some material that will support the learning experience about importing an existing cloud infrastructure into terraform. 

The very fist step has been to simplify the problem so the existing infrastructure we start from is very minimal. It lives in AWS and is made of: 

* an S3 Bucket
* a CloudFront distribution that serves the S3 bucket content

Simplifying the infrastructure will allow us to focus on the process
